# tutors-design

A log of my research into accessibility and universal design in regards to the Tutors app. 

Redesign of the Tutors colour scheme and course icons.

Using the tutors generator for the module structure. The module is deployed here:

- [Tutors-Design ](https://tutors-redesign.netlify.app/)

A local static version of the course can be built as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-starter.git
npx tutors-html
```

This will generate a web site in ./public-site.

To deploy the course using [tutors-design](https://github.com/edeleastar/tutors-design), clone this repo to your own github or bitbucket account, and follow [this lab step here](https://tutors-design.netlify.app/lab/tutors-course.netlify.app/topic-00-tutors-next/book-next/03).
