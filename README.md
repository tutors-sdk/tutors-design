# UI/UX Module

A log of my research into accessibility and universal design in regards to the Tutors app.

Using the tutors generator for the module structure. The module is deployed here:

- [Emma's Tester Course ](https://tutors-svelte.netlify.app/#/course/emmas-tester.netlify.app)

A local static version of the course can be built as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-starter.git
npx tutors-html
```

This will generate a web site in ./public-site.

To deploy the course using [tutors-design](https://github.com/edeleastar/tutors-design), clone this repo to your own github or bitbucket account, and follow [this lab step here](https://tutors-design.netlify.app/lab/tutors-course.netlify.app/topic-00-tutors-next/book-next/03).
